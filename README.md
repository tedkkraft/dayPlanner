# dayPlanner
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This app is lacking in styling as well as the functionality to color code time slots according to the time of day using moment.js

This app could be significantly improved by dynamically adding elements to the page and using for loops.
